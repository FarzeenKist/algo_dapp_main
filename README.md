The Dapp is a simulation of an online gadget store where users could buy 
gadgets in algos. I specifically modified the code to create an app with a unique id 
and marketplace  note specific to the buyer so that it is specifically owned by the buyer
and  an archive variable to make certian products scarce or hidden in the market,
a freebie feature that gives a freebie when certain amount of products are bought buy 
a particular buyer and applications created by certain accounts only get modified by those account.
